# Pages

The pages folder should mirror the app routes 
For example: This app only have 2 routes: / and /todo
- /: Sign in page. Could have use /sign-in but / is also usable
- /todo: Todo page. 

If this app ever has a view details of a todo, I would have route them as: 
- /todos
- /todos/:id 
and the folder structure should reflect that: 
- /Todo 
- /Todo/details or /Todo/pages/details
